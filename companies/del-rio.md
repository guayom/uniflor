Del Rio is a company committed to environmental preservation, efficiency and high performance.

Our main objective is QUALITY. We are proud of our excellent selection; quality control and packing process that allow us to deliver the highest quality flowers that satisfy our clients specific needs.

Obashe, S.A., started growing tropical flowers and foliage in March 1986. The farm is located in Limón, in the Atlantic Coast of Costa Rica. This area is where the Tropical Rainforest is located. It is 140meters above the sea level. It has an average temperature of 30°C all the year. Obashe made its first export to Florida, United States in 1986, and now we export to some other states in the US, Canada and some other countries in Europe.
